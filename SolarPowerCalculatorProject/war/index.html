			<h2>Welcome to saving, sunshine!!!</h2>
			<p>When installing a solar PV system, there are a number of steps to be followed. First of all, you must select a Clean Energy Council accredited installer. Different installers can offer different options and some of these options may be more suited to your needs than others. It is recommended that you conduct your own research before deciding on an installer.</p>

<p>Once you have decided on an installation company, that company will design a solar PV system to meet your requirements. They will also account for your preferences with regard to details such as the size of the system and the quality of the components used.</p>

<p>Next, the installer will contact your electricity distributor. Your electricity distributor will depend on where you live but will one of either Energex or Ergon Energy. The distributor will then send you an Application for Network Connection of an Inverter Energy System to sign. This form will also allow you to nominate your preferred metering arrangement.</p>

<p>When your distributor approves your application, they will send you a Network Connection Agreement to sign. Once the signed agreement is received by the distributor, your solar PV system can be installed. The necessary changes to wiring will also be carried out, usually by an electrical contractor. This contractor will then submit the appropriate form to instigate a Business-to-Business Service Order Request from your electricity distributor to your electricity retailer.</p>

<p>After this had been done, either you or the installation company must apply for connection to the network and arrange a Metering Additions and Alterations Service Order. Then your electricity distributor can carry out a safety inspection of your solar PV system.</p>

<p>Once these steps have been completed, your solar PV system is ready to use. Any electricity your system generates will be taken into account by your electricity retailer and your account will be changed accordingly. You can also apply for any applicable government rebates.;</p>
